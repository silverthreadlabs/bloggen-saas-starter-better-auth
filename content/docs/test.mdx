Getting Started with Fumadocs
        
## Introduction

Fumadocs <span className="text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm">(Foo-ma docs)</span> is a **documentation framework** based on Next.js, designed to be fast, flexible,
and composes seamlessly into Next.js App Router.

Fumadocs has different parts:



### Terminology

**Markdown/MDX:** Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text. Fumadocs supports Markdown and MDX (superset of Markdown) out-of-the-box.

Although not required, some basic knowledge of Next.js App Router would be useful for further customisations.

## Automatic Installation

A minimum version of Node.js 18 required, note that Node.js 23.1 might have problems with Next.js production build.

```bash tab="npm"
npm create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun create fumadocs-app
```

It will ask you:

* the React.js framework to use (the docs is only written for Next.js).
* the content source to use.

A new fumadocs app should be initialized. Now you can start hacking!


### Enjoy!

Create your first MDX file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"

title: Hello World

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs).

```npm
npm run dev
```
